        <h2>No to Drugs!!</h2>
        <p><em>https://www.grabellaw.com/how-to-say-no-to-drugs.html</em><br>
        <strong>MICHIGAN CRIMINAL LAWYERS</strong> A number of factors influence one's decision to use drugs. One of the leading factors for people in their teen years is peer pressure. The influences of a person's friends, whether good or bad, often plays a large part in decisions that are made. In some instances, even the influence of people who are not friends will affect a teen's actions. For example, a teen may want to be a part of a popular group of students in school; however, the group has not accepted him or her as a friend. In efforts to fit in or be accepted, the student may do something that is wrong because the people in the popular group are doing it. Often that "something" involves taking drugs or drinking alcohol. Confidence, <u>self-esteem</u>  and feelings of self-worth will go a long way toward helping a teen make the right decision and not just follow the crowd. When people are confident in themselves and in what they believe in, they are less likely to look toward outside sources to make them feel special.</p>
        
        <h2><u>History</u>:Phillipines World War II</h2>
        
        <p> <u>Japan</u> launched a surprise attack on the <strong> <i>Philippines</i></strong>  on December 8, 1941, just ten hours after the attack on <u>Pearl Harbor</u>. Initial aerial bombardment was followed by landings of ground troops both north and south of Manila. The defending Philippine and <strong><i>United States</i></strong> troops were under the command of General <u>Douglas MacArthur</u>, who had been recalled to active duty in the United States Army earlier in the year and was designated commander of the United States Armed Forces in the Asia-Pacific region. The aircraft of his command were destroyed; the naval forces were ordered to leave; and because of the circumstances in the Pacific region, reinforcement and resupply of his ground forces were impossible. Under the pressure of superior numbers, the defending forces withdrew to the Bataan Peninsula and to the island of Corregidor at the entrance to Manila Bay. Manila, declared an open city to prevent its destruction, was occupied by the Japanese on January 2, 1942.
